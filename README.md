# SakonninBundle

Started as an internal message handling system for symfony applications.

It har programmatical action on messages, like forward to SMS on mail with "ERROR" in subject, and so on.

Messages can be email, sms, "PM's" (Internal from system or between users) and more if you come up with a need.

And now the same way of handling messages will be applied to files.

But there is more. It's also used for notes on whatever entity in the system using the context thingie. (Link from a message/note/file/checkitem to something with the trio "system" "object_name" and "external_id".
