# SakonninBundle

A message/log/feedback handling bundle with callback/replies capabilities

This is mostly meant for being included in other applications for simple adding of log messages, in-app-messages on objects/pages and messages you send out from the system.

It also does internal messaging aka "PM".

And now the same way of handling messages will be applied to files.
